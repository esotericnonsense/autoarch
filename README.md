# autoarch

This is a basic script, adapted from

[archlinux/archiso.git](https://git.archlinux.org/archiso.git)

to perform an automated install of archlinux in a virtual machine.

## Important note

The created ISO will _completely erase_ the contents of the disk you point it
at (e.g. `vda` by default) without confirmation prior to installation.

Consider yourself warned.
